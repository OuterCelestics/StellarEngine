## Getting Started
Clone the repository & submodules
```bash
git clone -b dev --recursive https://github.com/Luke-Creative-Media/StellarEngine.git
```
Make sure you download the latest premake version: https://premake.github.io/download/ (currently using v5-beta2)

After downloading, place the premake5.exe into the "Scripts" folder. Next, execute the setup-windows.bat. With this setup completed, open the generated solution (*.sln) to build the GLFW project, and afterward, re-run the setup-windows.bat for any final configurations.

### Note that no macOS or Linux setup script is currently provided;
